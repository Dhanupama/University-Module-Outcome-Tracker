# University-Module-Outcome-Tracker
This Python program is designed to determine students' academic progression outcomes based on their pass, defer, and fail credits. It offers two modes: a student version for single entries and a staff version for multiple entries. Users start by selecting their modeâ€”entering '1' for student or '2' for staff. In both versions, users are prompted to enter credits in increments of 20, ensuring the total equals 120. The program then evaluates the credits to display one of the following outcomes: "Progress," "Progress (module trailer)," "Do not progress (module retriever)," or "Exclude." In the student version, this is done for a single entry, while the staff version allows multiple entries. After entering multiple sets of data, the staff can opt to view all results and see a graphical histogram representation using the `graphics` module, which visually displays the outcomes. Results are saved in a text file named `student_data.txt` for future reference. The program handles input validation, ensuring that credits are valid integers within the specified range, and prompts the user to correct any invalid entries. It provides a user-friendly interface to streamline the process of assessing student progression while also offering both text-based and graphical feedback.
